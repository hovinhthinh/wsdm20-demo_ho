%% article.

\begin{abstract}
	
 
Quantities are more than numeric values. They represent measures for entities, expressed in numbers with associated units. 
Search queries often include quantities, such as athletes who ran 200m under 20 seconds or companies with quarterly revenue above \$2 Billion. Processing such queries requires
understanding the quantities, where capturing the surrounding context is an essential part of it. 
Although modern search engines or QA systems handle entity-centric queries well, they consider numbers and units as simple keywords, and therefore fail to understand the condition (less than, above, etc.), the unit of interest (seconds, dollar, etc.), and the context of the quantity (200m race, quarterly revenue, etc.) 
As a result, they cannot generate the correct candidate answers.  
In this work, we demonstrate a prototype QA system, called Qsearch, 
that can handle advanced queries with quantity constraints using the common cues present in both query and the text sources.
%Quantities appear in search queries in numerous forms: 
%to find a products within a specific price range, 
%to locate a country with an increasing GDP, to identify athletes who won multiple Olympic medals, among others.
%companies with annual revenue of at least 50 Mio USD, athletes who ran 200 meters faster than 19.5 s, electric cars with range above 400 miles, and so on.
%Processing such queries requires the understanding of numbers present in the query to capture the contextual information about the queried entities. 
%Modern search engines and QA systems
%like Google, Bing, etc. can 
%efficiently handle queries that involve entities and types, 
%which need to exploit only relational structures embedded in Web content and social media for queried entities. 
%But they fail to produce crisp answers to the queries involving numerical constraints as they disregard the reasoning %over quantitative information.
%but they often fail on properly interpreting quantities in queries and candidate answers
%when the specifics of the search condition (less than, above, etc.), the units of interest (seconds, miles, meters, etc.)
%and the context of the quantity matter (annual or quarterly revenue, etc.).
%  
%Numeric answers for such queries might appear in various sources, either structured (e.g. tables, lists), or unstructured (e.g. text), where processing unstructured text are more challenging. 
%Modern search engines like Google, Bing, etc. support queries that involve relational structures embedded in Web content and social media and can provide crisp answers to the queries or questions. However, informative quantities are usually disregarded. 
%
%Approach and  Contribution

%tackles queries with numerical constraints by harnessing quantitative  contextual information about entities from text.
%can effectively answer advanced queries with quantity conditions, based on the evidence from text sources.
%Our solution is based on a deep neural network for extracting quantity-centric tuples from text sources,
%and a novel matching model to 
%retrieve and rank
%answers 
%from news articles and other web pages.

%In particular, we propose a framework for representing quantitative information, 
%an efficient deep neural network for extracting these information from textual data, 
%produce 
%for given numerical queries. 
%Experiments 
%on real-world data 
%demonstrate the effectiveness of Qsearch on benchmark queries collected by crowdsourcing.
