\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented the Qsearch demo system for full-fledged support of
quantity queries, with novel approaches of information representation, information extraction and answer matching/ranking.
We capture quantities in complete extent, including measurement units, reference entities and appropriate contexts.
In the future, we plan to enhance the work further by integrating more data sources and provide better Web interface to the users.
